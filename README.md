Java and python used for integration of Gmail, Paypal for transactions, google sign in to login and LinkedIn integration to check the profile informations.
SQL and Linux has been used for database management.
This whole project of website designing is on my local hard drive due to which it may not be properly visible but all the codes are accesible.
